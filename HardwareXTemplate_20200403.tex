\section{Hardware in context}
% Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.
EEG, ECG etc are important medical devices
also useful for biopotential research, e.g. BCI, sea slugs
cost of devices is a barrier, need for open hardware
whatever groovy things HardwareX has published recently

\textit{Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.}
\section{Hardware description}
% Describe the hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps of the procedure. Highlight how it differs/which advantage it offers over pre-existing methods. For example, how could this hardware: be compared to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, be used in the development of further designs in a particular area, and so on.

% > Add 3-5 bulleted points to broadly explain to other researchers how the hardware could be potentially useful to them, for either standard or novel laboratory tasks, inside or outside of the original user community.
