\section{Hardware in context}
% Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.
EEG, ECG etc are important medical devices
also useful for biopotential research, e.g. BCI, sea slugs
cost of devices is a barrier, need for open hardware
whatever groovy things HardwareX has published recently

\textit{Include a short description of the hardware, putting into context of similar open hardware and proprietary equipment in the field.}
\section{Hardware description}
% Describe the hardware, highlighting the customization rather than the steps of the procedure. Highlight how it differs/which advantage it offers over pre-existing methods. For example, how could this hardware: be compared to other hardware in terms of cost or ease of use, be used in the development of further designs in a particular area, and so on.

% > Add 3-5 bulleted points to broadly explain to other researchers how the hardware could be potentially useful to them, for either standard or novel laboratory tasks, inside or outside of the original user community.

\begin{itemize}
\item story runs from the familiar to the exotic (arduino/usb -> EEG signals)
\item SAM3X; USB 2.0 interface utility of Arduino compatibility
\item Importance of electrical isolation; measures taken
\item ADS1299 ADC
\item antialiasing filters
\item challenges of biopotential signals
\item patient disconnect lights
\item top boards/choice for touchproof connectors
\item mention firmware and arduino shield extensibility in passing
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Able to measure signals on the order of microvolts with input impedances of a few kiloohms
\item Reinforced electrical isolation of analog inputs for safety of patient/subject
\item Open hardware; low cost compared to commercial alternatives
\item Compatible with Arduino software and extensible via Arduino shields
\item Uses industry standard DIN 42 802 1.5 mm touch-proof plugs for patient connections
\end{itemize}

\section{Design files}
% The  complete  design  files  must  be  either  uploaded  to  an  approved  online  repository,  uploaded  at the  time  of  submission  on  the  online  Editorial  Manager  submission  interface  as  supplementary materials [CAD files, videos,. . . ], or included in the body of the manuscript [e.g.  figures].  The three approved  online  repositories  are  Mendeley  Data,  the  Open  Science  Framework,  and  Zenodo. See repository instructions: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3346799

The design files can be found at: \text{https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/42TKV}

\subsection{Design Files Summary}
% Please include a summary of all design files for your hardware by filling rows of the table below

% We should look at moving most generated files to a top-level directory
% Consider explaining a manifest of some sort in the repo itself with this
% information plus the purpose of each file

\section{Bill of materials}
% For a complex Bill of Materials, the complete Bill of Materials (editable spreadsheet file e.g., ODS file type or PDF file) can be uploaded in an open access online location such as the Open Science Framework repository. Include the link here. Alternatively, the Bill of Materials can be uploaded at the time of submission on the online Elsevier submission interface as supplementary material.

% > To make it easy to tell which item in the Bill of Materials corresponds to which component in your design file(s), use matching designators in both places, or otherwise explain the correspondence.

% > For material type, select from: Metal, semi-conductor, ceramic, polymer, biomaterial, organic, inorganic, composite, nanomaterial, semiconductor, non-specific, or other
