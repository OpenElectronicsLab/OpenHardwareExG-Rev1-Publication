For CAD files, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, or Blender are encouraged, but if not available source files from proprietary CAD packages such as Autocad or Solidworks and other drawing packages are acceptable.
\item 3D printing. Supplementary files that facilitate the digital replication of the devices are encouraged. For example, STL files for 3-D printing components. We recommend uploading CAD files to the NIH 3D Print Exchange as Custom Labware and providing a link to the location.
\item Electronics. PCB layouts and other electronics design files can be uploaded to the Open Hardware Repository or other repositories.
\item Software and firmware. All software files used in the design and operation of the hardware should be included in the repository. Provide a description of software and firmware and use extensive comments in the code.}
